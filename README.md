My hands-on Cyber Security Projects
Hi, I'm Atrayee â€” an enthusiastic cybersecurity learner with a strong passion for protecting digital systems and identifying vulnerabilities. My background includes hands-on learning in network security, Linux commands, and threat analysis, supported by the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, CompTIA Network +, CEH, CompTIA Security+ preparation.
I'm currently building a cybersecurity portfolio that includes practical projects like conducting security audits, managing file permissions, writing safe SQL queries, and documenting mock incident responses.
My goal is to grow into a Cybersecurity Analyst role where I can contribute to securing real-world infrastructures, detect threats, and respond to incidents effectively.
This GitHub portfolio reflects my learning journey and commitment to continuous improvement in the field of cybersecurity.
